This is a MazeRace game similiar to the the MazeCraze game originally designed by Atari in 1978, but simplified for CSC108. 

The first player Ada is controlled by WASD and is marked by
A. The second player Charles is controlled by IJKL and is 
marked by C. The first one to reach the goal G in the least number of steps wins.

To run the game, you need a maze layout. A few examples have been provided as txt files. In a Linux or Unix Shell, run Java MazeRaceDriver <mazelayout> <interface> where mazelayout is the name of your txt file and interface is either text for the text game or gui for the windowed game.
